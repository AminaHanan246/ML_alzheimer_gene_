# Machine Learning For Biomarker Discovery for Alzheimer's Disease

This repository contains a complete machine learning workflow for biomarker discovery, from gene expression data to identifying gene as potential biomarkers. The project demonstrates pre-processing, feature scaling, dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and feature attribution (SHAP) using Python.
